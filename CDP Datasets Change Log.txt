## Cleaning applied to all datasets

    * Renamed columns so all datasets with the same values/topics are uniform 
    * Cleaned up extraneous characters 
    * Removed population year 
    * Emissions occurring outside city boundary (metric tonnes CO2e) for Total Generation of grid supplied energy (Renamed to Other)
    * Values that are 0 or - for Accounting_year replaced with NULL 
    * Accounting_year changed to Inv_year 
    * Simplified Inv_year to just 1 year 

-------------------------------------

##2022 City Plans Dataset 


## ADDED 

    *City column with blanks, input the city name using the org_name, the org_name column notes the city.
    *Added state column using org_name, org_name column notes state.

## MISSING VALUES 

    * Cities for organizations input where possible, otherwise left null
    * Org_names with both a city and county listed, inputed city name for city
    * State values for organizations input where possible, otherwise left null

## REMOVED

/* Extraneous columns not pertaining to business task (descriptors not important to defining emissions, demographic information, or policy-related information)*/
    * Questionnaire
    * Reporting year ##the dataset year is identified by the file name 
    * Access 
    * Last update 
    * CDP Region ## Country of origin is US, column not needed.
    * Attachment/link and name of plan
    * Confirm attachment/link provided
	
	* Filtered out countries that are not the United States, removed these rows from the dataset 


## CHANGED 

/* Renamed columns for ease of analysis and querying */ 
	* Replaced spaces with underscores for ease of querying 
	* Replaced special characters with standard characters (e.g., accent marks)
	* Adjusted values within Inv_year that have a range to reflect the year the value started in 

## Other

Sorted, and reviewed range of values for all columns to identify for outlier data (especially numeric). None found.
Used =MAX(LENGTH()) to identify max cell characters to create limit for SQL table.
